Lab 7: More on proofs
Exercise
Problem:

A staircase has n steps. You can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many distinct ways are there to
reach the top?

Task:

Design and implement an iterative algorithm in Dafny that solves this problem. Prove the correctness
of your iterative implementation by specifying the properties it must satisfy.

Hint: First define a recursive function that specifies what the correct answer should be, then use this
function in the specs of your iterative method to prove correctness.
