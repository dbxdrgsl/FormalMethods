      Formal Methods in Software Engineering
                Laboratory 10-12


   This homework is for the laboratories 10-12. Deadline: 14.01.2024.
Since the topics of the next three courses includes the foundations needed for
program/code static analysis, the main goal of this homework is to make exper-
iments with a performant code static analysis tool for your favoured program-
ming language. Lists with such tools can be found at the following addresses:
https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis
  1. If you have NO experience in using a static analyzer:
      (a) Investigate what analysis tools are suitable
      (b) Choose and install an appropriate tool for (one of) your favoured
          language. If you choose a trial version, then be careful how long time
          you can used.
      (c) Read the documentation and experiment several case studies, de-
          scribed in the documentation.
      (d) Use the tool to analyze one of your recent projects. Write the expe-
          rience in the Google Drive document (named ”lab 10-12”):
             i. Describe the methodology followed to analyze the project.
            ii. Describe the issues reported by the tool and how these issues
                were fixed. Try to exploit all the functionalities of the tool.
           iii. Write the conclusions of this experience.
  2. If you have experience in using a static analyzer:
      (a) Use the tool to analyze one of your recent projects that was not
          analyzed before. Write the experience in the Google Drive document
          (named ”lab 10-12”):
             i. Describe the methodology followed to analyze the project.
            ii. Describe the issues reported by the tool and how these issues
                were fixed. Try to exploit all the functionalities of the tool.
           iii. Write the conclusions of this experience.
      (b) Do some experiments with Github Copilot and try to figure out how
          the tool can be used to validate the code suggested by the copilot.
          Describe the experience and the conclusion in the Google document.
