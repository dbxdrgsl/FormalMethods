   Formal Methods in Software Engineering
               Laboratory 7


1. Implement (at least) three algorithms from Chapter 10 (Elementary Data
   Structures), Introduction to Algorithms, Th. Cormen et al. (an electronic
   copy can be found here:
   https://sd.blackball.lv/library/Introduction_to_Algorithms_Third_
   Edition_(2009).pdf).
   Consider that the data structures are implemented using arrays and each
   algorithm is represented by a separated method, where the data structure
   is given as a parameter (no classes, yet).
   Write specifications for the solved problems and prove their correctness
   w.r.t. the specifications.
