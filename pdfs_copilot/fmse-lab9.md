   Formal Methods in Software Engineering
               Laboratory 9


1. Specify and implement in Dafny a class that implements the linked lists,
   as they are described in Section 10.2 Linked lists, Introduction to Algo-
   rithms, Th. Cormen et al. (an electronic copy can be found here:
   https://sd.blackball.lv/library/Introduction_to_Algorithms_Third_
   Edition_(2009).pdf).
   Then write the contracts of the class and show that (using Dafny) that it
   respects the contracts:
   (a) Add the ghost members needed to write specifications.
   (b) Write the class invariants that describe the valid states of the class
       objects.
   (c) for each method, write its specification (precondition and postcondi-
       tion = its contract) and show that the method implementation ver-
       ifies it. The specification must describe faithfully what the method
       should do.

  You may use as a starting point the specification of the class Node from
  the Section 1.2. Dafny Example, Dafny Reference Manual
  (https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-example).
